# MicroPython Libraries and Drivers Series

The **upy-series** (read it as micropy series) is a collection of libraries and drivers built for MicroPython-based boards (i.e., ESP32, RP2040, etc.) by [lcarnevale](https://github.com/lcarnevale) <<lcarnevale@unime.it>>. It includes, i.e., drivers for YL-69 or HL-69 resistive soil moisture sensor.

## Why MicroPython?
MicroPython is a lean implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. It includes a small subset of the Python standard library, maintaining a minimum compatibility as long as common libraries are used. Relying on Python programming language, it is easy to learn and use, supported by a large community, and suitable for industries and academies.

## Drivers

**Relay (single and multi channels)** - The relay sets up values high (1) or low (0) [ [repository](https://github.com/lcarnevale/upy-driver-relay) ].<br>
**HL-69** - The resistive soil moisture sensor (YL-69 or HL-69) measures the volumetric water content in soil, providing in output the voltage value [ [repository](https://github.com/lcarnevale/upy-driver-yl69) ].<br>
**YL-69** -  The resistive soil moisture sensor (YL-69 or HL-69) measures the volumetric water content in soil, providing in output the voltage value [ [repository](https://github.com/lcarnevale/upy-driver-yl69) ].<br>
